While building this game, we want to maximise and minimise certain things.

1. We want to maximise code quality. Write high quality code which follows software development best practices. 

2. We want to minimise cost.  Be smart about how many tokens you use to achieve basic tasks.  Take clever shortcuts which will save you in tokens where possible.  For example, use docs/PATHS.md to quackly find your way around the project files, instead of manually listing files in different folders. 

3. We want to complete one whole module at a time, before moving on to the next module.  Get the module code all written, then write a basic unit test suite for the module and get the tests passing.  Last of all, update the documentation to reflect the changes, and then prompt the human to manually test out the new module in-game.  We want to always try as much as possible to leave the game in a working state so we can continually user-test it.
