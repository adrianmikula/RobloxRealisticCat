I want to make a super-realistic NPC cat, which can interact with players and other object in the world  in realtime. 

# PHASE ONE

The cats will each have their own unique personality profile, which will affect how they interact with the world and players.  Each cat will have a fluctuating mood and physical state, e.g. happy, curious, annoyed, hungry, tired, afraid, etc.  Players will be able to hold certain types of tools to interact (e.g. food, toys), and cats will be able to climb trees, eat food items, etc.

I want the scripting for the game to be built using a proper client-server model so it can scale well.   The game will be able to scale the number of NPC cats anywhere from 10 cat to 100 cats and still perform well with up to 1000 concurrent players. 


# PHASE TWO 

They will also have a permanently saved relatrionship/rapport with players (either good or bad) which is slowly built up over multiple interactrions.   I want all of the uniqueness of the cats to be defined via configuration properties so they are easy to customise for each cat profile (ie.e. no hardcoded personality profiles).  

I also want to add interaction actions that users can activate by pressing the E button.  For example, patting the cat, picking it up, etc.



# PHASE THREE

User customisation.  I want to add a game UI which allows users to add their own cats to the game, complete with custom breed, appearance and personality.  Eventually I want this game to allow anyone to add a realistic NPC version of their own real life cat to the game.


I also want to add monetisation.  In order to add a custom cat, users need to pay Robux.



# PHASE FOUR

I want to enhance the skins and animations so that different cats can have a customised appearance based primarily on breed. Different breeds of cat can use a common set of base templates, but within the breed there will still be variations based on cat age, weight and gender.  I want refine and improve visual aspects like cat fur to see if it's possible to make it look more realistic than the typical Roblox models, while still keeping the game performance within acceptable limits.
