lets research if there is a good way to set up unit tests using a popular testing library so they can be run via the command line without requiring the game to be running inside Roblox.  we will be able to develop much faster if you can easily run the tests without requiring human intervention.  we already tried TestEz but found some problems with it. Lets see if there are any other popular and mature testing libraries that would be worth trying. 

I have already set up several testing libraries documented in docs\codebase\DEV_ENV.md.  Lune, Jest-Lua, and run-in-roblox are some of the options. Lets try out different testing approaches until we find one that we can script via the command line without needing to manually open roblox

the current tests in the codease are already documented under the folder docs\testing

continue by trying out each of the cli/local approaches until we get one of them working
