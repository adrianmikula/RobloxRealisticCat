The game will be documented in the following way.

1. docs/requirements folder will contain details about all the required features and gemaplay behaviour of the game

2. docs/codebase folder will contain details about how the game modules are structured and implemented, and how the different modules interact.

3. docs/tasks folder will contain current tasks we are working on, and any problems or bugs we are currently trying to solve.

The documentation should be kept up to date as we build the game.
